An AI security engineer can already tell whether *one* agent is allowed to do
*one* thing. HIVE answers a question no single-agent policy can: **has this
population of agents quietly composed a capability nobody granted it?**

1. [The problem, in four lines of log](#the-problem-in-four-lines-of-log) — the
   whole thesis, and the fastest way to decide whether the rest is worth your
   time.
2. [Open the console](https://vighriday.github.io/hive-agent-security/console/) and press **Run to end**, then
   **Apply recommended control**. That round trip is the product.
3. [Does it actually work?](#does-it-actually-work) — what is tested, and what
   each gate would catch.
4. [What HIVE does not do](#what-hive-does-not-do) — the limits, stated up
   front rather than found by you.

Everything else is supporting detail.

## The problem, in four lines of log

Each of these is an action its actor is explicitly permitted to take.

```text
Support Agent    read   Fictional CRM                     ← allowed: support reads customer records
Support Agent    write  Unregistered Shared Scratchpad    ← a scratchpad is just a scratchpad
Reporting Agent  read   Unregistered Shared Scratchpad    ← reporting reads what it is given
Reporting Agent  send   Simulated External Webhook        ← allowed: reporting is *for* sending reports
```

No permission was violated. No agent misbehaved. Nothing here would trip a
per-action policy engine, a prompt firewall, or an audit of any individual
agent's scopes.

And yet restricted customer data can now leave the estate.

The capability belongs to **the population**, not to any member of it. It was
assembled out of four permissions that were each correctly granted, and it
appeared the moment an ordinary read happened to connect two halves that were
never meant to touch.

That is the class of risk HIVE exists to find.

---

## Two things to look at

HIVE is two artefacts, and they are deliberately not the same kind of thing.

| | Where | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **The overview** | <https://vighriday.github.io/hive-agent-security/> | The argument. Why a population is the unit of analysis, and where this sits beside defences you already run. Its diagrams are **conceptual simulations**, and the page labels every one of them as such. |
| **The console** | <https://vighriday.github.io/hive-agent-security/console/> | The engine. Every finding, path, plan and verification on screen is output from the Python in this repository. None of it is drawn by hand. |

Neither needs a backend or an API key. The console ships with the engine's
recorded output at every replay position, so the hosted page is fully
interactive with nothing running behind it — and it says **recorded session**
on screen rather than implying a live service.

### What is demonstrated, and what is illustrated

A submission that blurs this line is worth less than one that draws it, so:

**Produced by the engine.** Reproducible, covered by tests, byte-identical on
every replay — this is what the console shows and what CI asserts:

- the composed path and the finding, from the detection rules
- the containment plan, its cost ordering, and the two controls it *rejects*
  for severing declared work
- the verification, measured by re-running the rules over the contained graph
- the immunity pattern, and the Swarm Lab result for any recorded configuration

**Illustrative, and labelled on the page itself.** The overview's agent
populations, incident timelines, emergence values and blast-radius percentages
are conceptual — they show how the reasoning works, not a measured result. The
page states this in full: *"Every number, agent, graph and incident on this page
is a conceptual simulation running in your browser. There are no customers, no
deployments and no measured accuracy claims."*

If you only trust one of the two, trust the console — and
[the tests](#does-it-actually-work) behind it.

<details>
<summary><b>Run it locally in about a minute</b></summary>

Prerequisites: Python 3.12 with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), Node 22 with
[pnpm](https://pnpm.io/). Nothing else — no API keys, no cloud account, no
model provider.

```bash
# Terminal 1 — the analysis engine
cd services/core
uv sync --group dev
uv run uvicorn hive_core.main:app --port 8000

# Terminal 2 — the console
cd apps/console
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:5173>. The console finds the service and the badge in the
header reads **live engine**. Without it, the badge reads **recorded session**
and everything still works.

</details>

---

## The argument, on one page

The [overview](https://vighriday.github.io/hive-agent-security/) exists because the finding below is worthless if
you do not already believe the problem is real. It makes that case in four
moves.

![The HIVE overview page: security for what happens between agents](docs/assets/10-overview-hero.png)

**Same three actors, checked two ways.** On the left, each agent is evaluated
alone: identity authenticated, tools within grant, behaviour nominal — three of
three pass. On the right, the same three are connected through shared state, and
a capability appears that nobody granted. Every check on the left is correct.
Every check on the left is blind to the others.

![Individual view passing three of three while the population view shows a path emerging](docs/assets/11-individual-vs-population.png)

**It is not a replacement for anything.** Model, prompt, identity, tool and
data-layer defences all stay necessary. HIVE watches one level up: what the
ecosystem becomes *while every layer below is working correctly*.

![The security layer stack, with population behaviour security added below the existing layers](docs/assets/12-not-prompt-injection.png)

**The graph is the object of study.** Agents, data, tools, memory, MCP servers,
identities and external systems in one continuously rebuilt view — and any node
opened to show its grants, its baseline and what it has recently touched.

![The behaviour graph with a node inspector open on a support agent](docs/assets/13-behavior-graph.png)

**The problem is documented by people other than me.** OWASP's agentic top ten,
an open-problems paper, and three industry notes on emergent coordination and
lateral movement between agents. The page is explicit that none of them is
affiliated with HIVE and none of them validates it.

![A table of six external research sources on multi-agent security](docs/assets/14-research.png)

<details>
<summary><b>What the overview does not claim</b></summary>

The populations, timelines, emergence values and impact percentages on that page
are conceptual simulations generated in the browser. They are there to show the
shape of the reasoning. They are not measured results, and the page says so
beside each of them, including a standing note that there are *"no customers, no
deployments and no measured accuracy claims."*

Everything below this point is different: it is the engine.

</details>

---

## Watch the engine do it

Now the other artefact. The four-line sequence above is not an illustration of
the product — it *is* the product, and this is it running. Every panel below is
output from `services/core`, captured from the console:

![The HIVE console with a composed risk path highlighted](docs/assets/00-hero.png)

**1 — Baseline.** The declared architecture, doing exactly what it was designed
to do. Zones run from the trusted interior at the top to the outside world at
the bottom.

![Baseline topology](docs/assets/01-baseline.png)

**2 — Emergence.** An undeclared scratchpad appears between two agents. Amber,
dashed: observed, but absent from the manifest. Still no finding — data has gone
in, but nothing has taken it out.

**3 — The path closes.** At event 12 the Reporting Agent *reads* the scratchpad.
An unremarkable action. It introduces no new permission and breaks no rule. It
completes a route from restricted data to the outside world, and the route
descends through every trust band on the map.

![The composed path](docs/assets/02-detected.png)

**4 — The finding.** Named hops, cited evidence, and an explicit statement of
what the conclusion does *not* support.

![Finding detail](docs/assets/04-finding.png)

Three of the four hops are relationships the architecture **permits**. That is
the argument: the composition is the fault, not any single action in it.

**5 — The signals.** Fixed weights that sum to 1.00, so the score is
reconstructible by hand. A signal that did not fire keeps its row and shows
`0.00` rather than disappearing.

![Weighted risk signals](docs/assets/05-signals.png)

**6 — Containment.** Every pre-authorised control, evaluated against the live
graph by simulation.

![Containment candidates](docs/assets/03-containment.png)

Look at the bottom two rows. Both **remove the path**. Both are **rejected** —
because blocking the external send would sever the Reporting Agent's declared
job, and blocking the CRM read would stop Support doing its own. HIVE picks the
cheapest control that removes every unsafe path *and* breaks nothing the
architecture declares.

**7 — Verification.** Measured after the fact, by re-running the rules over the
contained graph — not by trusting the planner's prediction.

![Verification report](docs/assets/07-verified.png)

The map agrees. The red path is gone, the scratchpad sits isolated in amber, and
every declared relationship is still there.

![Contained topology](docs/assets/06-contained.png)

Exactly one relationship was severed. The agent's *discovery* of the scratchpad
survives, because containment is scoped to an action rather than to a pair of
nodes.

**8 — Memory.** The abstracted pattern is recorded as a **draft**. Promotion to
shadow, then active, is a person's decision — one rung at a time.

![Immunity memory](docs/assets/08-immunity.png)

## The scenario as a graph

    class SP odd
```

Solid edges are declared in the manifest. Dashed amber edges are not. The
finding is the composition `CRM → Support → Scratchpad → Reporting → Webhook`,
of which only the two scratchpad hops are undeclared.

```

Four separations hold everywhere in the code:

| Separation | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| **Observation is not intent** | A trace proves an event was *reported*. It never proves why. |
| **Unexpected is not malicious** | HIVE reports structural deviation. It never concludes an agent is hostile. |
| **Detection is not enforcement** | A finding produces a *proposal*. A control runs only from a pre-authorised list. |
| **The ledger is not the graph** | Events are the evidence. The graph is a rebuildable view of them. |

```

The planner's simulation and the live control both call **one function**,
`apply_control`. That is why the verification can be trusted: what was
predicted and what was performed cannot be different operations.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why a naive graph search finds nothing here</b></summary>

Interactions are recorded the way a collector sees them — `actor → resource`:

```text
Support Agent --read--> Fictional CRM
```

But data travels the *other* way across a read. Ask "can the CRM reach the
webhook?" on the interaction graph and the answer is always no, because a data
source has no outgoing edges at all.

HIVE keeps a second orientation, `data_flow_graph()`, that reverses reads and
drops discovery (learning that something exists moves no content). Reachability
on *that* graph is the question people actually mean, and it is what the
invariant checker uses to produce a witness path.

PS-001 does not rely on reachability at all. It composes the hops explicitly —
ingest, deposit, withdrawal, egress — so the finding can name each one, mark it
declared or not, and cite the exact events behind it.

</details>

## Two rules, on two different estates

| Rule | What it detects | Fires on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **PS-001** | Restricted data reaching external egress through undeclared shared state | `p0_scenario` — a support/reporting estate |
| **PS-002** | One actor executing content another actor authored through undeclared shared state | `p1_scenario` — a software delivery estate |

PS-002 is the structural precondition behind indirect prompt injection,
expressed as a property of the topology rather than of any message. It is
deliberately **gated on manifest deviation**: a planner approving work and a
build agent executing it is cross-actor *by design*, and an operator who
declared both halves has accepted that channel. HIVE reports the channels nobody
declared.

The second estate shares no node names with the first. It exists to show the
rules are properties of a topology, not special cases tuned to one story.

---

## Swarm Lab: ask before you deploy

The replay answers *what happened*. The lab answers a design question: **given a
population this size, with these permissions and this much shared state, can a
dangerous composition form at all?**

![Swarm Lab](docs/assets/09-lab.png)

It is not scoring topologies with a formula. It synthesises a real manifest,
generates a real observation stream, and runs the same `PS001Detector`,
`PS002Detector` and `ContainmentPlanner` the console uses. Runs are seeded from
their own configuration, so a setting always yields the same conclusion.

Two things it will tell you that a dashboard would not:

- **The negative result.** Shared state with no external capability composes
  nothing — and the lab says which parameter to change to close the path.
- **Scale changes the answer.** At 24 agents, only **1 of 9** registered controls
  remains viable: targeted blocks stop being sufficient once several agents
  deposit into the same resource, and quarantine becomes the only action that
  removes every path.

---

## Does it actually work?

**231 tests.** The suite is organised around what HIVE claims, not around its
modules.

```bash
cd services/core && uv run pytest -q     # 195 passed
cd apps/console  && pnpm test            #  23 passed
cd apps/console  && pnpm test:e2e        #  13 passed
```

The ones that carry weight:

- **Necessary conditions.** Each of PS-001's four preconditions is removed in
  turn and the rule must go silent; all four together must fire. A rule that
  cried wolf whenever shared state existed would pass a positive test and fail
  these.
- **Simulation equals reality.** All five registered controls are applied for
  real and compared against what the planner predicted. This is the property the
  entire containment argument rests on.
- **Scoped containment.** Severing the write must leave the *discover* between
  the same two nodes intact.
- **Determinism.** Two independent sessions, and one session reset and replayed,
  must produce identical conclusions. Stepping event-by-event must converge on
  the same state as jumping. And the whole ledger — including the control HIVE
  issued and the pattern it recorded — must come out **byte-identical** across
  two detect-contain cycles, which is why nothing in it is stamped from a clock.
- **Rule and invariant agree.** Two independently implemented checks of the same
  claim are compared at all twelve replay positions.
- **No malice claimed.** Finding prose is asserted not to contain *malicious*,
  *attacker*, *compromised*, *breach*, or *exfiltrated*.
- **Property-based.** Hypothesis generates arbitrary event streams over the
  estate and asserts the invariants hold for all of them: detection is pure,
  cited evidence was actually observed, a recommended control really does remove
  the path and really does preserve declared work, and a control only ever
  *removes* relationships.
- **Contract is generated.** `contracts/openapi/hive-core-v1.json` is rendered
  from the running service and CI fails on any diff, so the committed spec cannot
  drift from the code.
- **The hosted demo cannot drift.** The recording the public console replays is
  regenerated from the engine in CI and compared byte for byte with the one in
  the repository. If the engine changes and the recording does not, the build
  fails — so the page you can click is the code you can read.
- **The browser journey** runs the full operator flow — identically against the
  live engine and the recorded snapshot.

CI runs formatter, linter, `mypy --strict`, and every suite above on each push.

Don't want to run any of it? The
[v1.0.0 release](https://github.com/vighriday/hive-agent-security/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
carries a verification bundle — the raw output of every command above, plus the
drift gates regenerating the contract and the recorded demo and diffing them to
nothing. It is there so these claims can be checked without installing a thing.

---

## What HIVE does not do

Stating this plainly is part of the design, not a disclaimer.

- It does **not** detect all emergent behaviour. It implements two rules.
- It does **not** determine intent, and never concludes an agent is malicious.
- It does **not** enforce anything. Controls are simulated and write a ledger
  event; no external system is touched.
- It does **not** inspect payloads. It establishes that a path *exists*, not that
  data traversed it.
- It does **not** learn autonomously. Patterns are drafts until a person
  promotes them.
- The emergence score **ranks** findings. The factor list is what explains them.
- The **overview page** is an argument, not evidence. Its populations, incidents
  and percentages are conceptual simulations, labelled as such on the page. The
  console is the part that produces real output.

## Safety

- All actors, stores, destinations and events are **fictional**.
- The "external webhook" and "public source" are labels in a YAML file. Nothing
  is ever contacted.
- Controls are simulated: applying one appends a `block` event to a local
  in-memory ledger.
- Ingest **redacts** any context key that could carry payload content or
  credentials, so sensitive content never reaches the ledger in the first place.
- Local CORS origins only; no wildcard, no credentials.
- See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## AI and external tools disclosure

Required by the challenge rules, and given in full.

AI tools were used throughout development. Gemini was used for background
research on multi-agent security and prior art. Claude was used for UI and
visual design work on the console. ChatGPT and Antigravity were used for
solution architecting and for working through the detection and containment
design. AI-assisted coding tools were used during implementation, alongside
review and debugging.

Two things are worth being precise about:

1. **No AI sits in the product.** HIVE's detection, path analysis, containment
   planning and verification are deterministic Python. There is no model call
   anywhere in the runtime, no API key, and no network dependency. The demo
   behaves identically offline.
2. **The work is understood.** Every design decision above — the multigraph, the
   data-flow orientation, the simulate-equals-apply guarantee, the manifest
   gating on PS-002, the choice to reject controls that sever declared work —
   is explainable and is covered by a test that would fail if it were wrong.
