"""Use-case orchestration for one replay session.

This is the only layer that knows the order of operations: fold events into the
projection, run the rules, plan containment, issue a control, verify what the
control actually did, and record the pattern. Every step below delegates the
decision itself to the domain module that owns it.

Determinism is the contract. Two sessions constructed from the same manifest and
fixture, advanced to the same cursor, produce identical findings, identical
candidate evaluations, and an identical recommendation. That property is what
turns a demo into evidence, and :meth:`fingerprint` exists so a test can assert
it directly.
