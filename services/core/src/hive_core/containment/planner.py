"""Constrained, counterfactual containment planning.

Three properties make this defensible rather than decorative:

**Constrained.** The planner may only choose from the control capabilities an
operator registered in the manifest. It cannot invent an action, and it has no
general kill switch.

**Counterfactual.** Each candidate is evaluated by cloning the live projection,
applying that control to the clone, and re-running the detector. "Does this
work?" is answered by simulation, not by a rule about which edge looks
important.

**Faithful.** The simulation calls the same graph primitive the control adapter
calls when the plan is applied for real. A ``block_edge`` control is scoped to
``source --action--> target`` in both places, so what the planner predicts is
exactly what happens. That equivalence is the reason the post-containment
verification can be trusted.

Selection rule: among the candidates that remove every unsafe path *and* leave
every observed expected relationship intact, take the cheapest. Ties break on
capability id so a replay always yields the same recommendation.
