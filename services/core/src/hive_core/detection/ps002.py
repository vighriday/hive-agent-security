"""PS-002 — one agent executes content another agent authored.

The shape of the risk
---------------------
Agent A writes to a shared resource. Agent B later runs what it finds there::

    Research Agent    --write-->    Shared Task Queue
    Shared Task Queue <--execute--  Build Agent

Each half looks routine. Composed, they form an indirect instruction channel:
whatever reaches Agent A's output — including content Agent A itself ingested
from an untrusted source — becomes something Agent B will run. This is the
structural precondition behind indirect prompt injection and cross-agent
tool-chaining, expressed as a property of the topology rather than of any
individual message.

The rule fires on the *shape*, not on payload inspection. HIVE never reads
content; it observes that an execute relationship consumes a resource written
by a different actor, and it reports which hop made that possible.

Escalation
----------
Severity rises when the writing actor itself ingested from outside the estate
or from a resource the architecture does not declare, because the channel then
reaches all the way from untrusted input to execution.
