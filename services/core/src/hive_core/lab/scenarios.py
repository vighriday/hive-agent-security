"""Scenario fixtures: deterministic, fictional event streams.

A scenario is a JSON Lines file. Each line is one observation. Loading validates
every line through the ingest boundary, so a fixture cannot introduce an event
shape the platform would refuse from a real collector.

Duplicate ``event_id`` values are rejected at load time. The ledger deduplicates
by id, which means a fixture with repeated ids silently loses events and the
scenario quietly stops matching its own description. Failing loudly here is the
difference between a demo that is reproducible and one that only looks it.
