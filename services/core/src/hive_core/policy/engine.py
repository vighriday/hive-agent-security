"""Manifest loading and invariant evaluation.

An invariant is a structural property the architecture must never exhibit,
written by an operator in the manifest. Detection rules explain *how* a specific
risk arose; invariants answer the blunter question of *whether* the estate is
currently in a state its owner declared unacceptable.

The two are deliberately independent. A rule can be wrong or incomplete without
the invariant check being wrong, and the console shows both.
